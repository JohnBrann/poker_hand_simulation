Simulates a card game where a deck of 52 cards are shuffled. Four players each draw 11 cards in turn-based order. The goal is to run the game until one player has all four Aces (or a specified card rank) in their hand. For each trial, I track the number of games played until this condition is met and repeat the experiment 100 times to calculate the average number of games needed for success.

The expected number of games to achieve this success is estimated to be around 206. 100 Expirements are run with 100 trials per expiremnt to prove this. Each trial plays games until it reaches a success.
